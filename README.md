# Fork community.general.consul

A fork of [community.general.consul](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/consul_module.html) to add support for meta data. 

Why didn't I just do a PR? Not sure if this is ready yet. We are still kicking the tires with using Anisble to register Consul services and not sure how long it would take to get a PR of this feature back into the main branch.
